Mini Lesson: Introduction to Machine Learning
Topic: What is Machine Learning?

Objective:

Understand the basic concept of machine learning.
Differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning.
Agenda:

Introduction
Definition: Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers learn from data.
Types of Learning (4 mins):
Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices).
Unsupervised Learning: Uses unlabeled data (e.g., clustering customers by purchasing behavior).
Examples and Applications (2 mins):
Real-world examples: Email spam filtering, recommendation systems, image recognition.
Q&A and Discussion (2 mins):
Open floor for questions and interactive discussion.
Teaching Method:

Encourage participation by asking students to provide their own examples.
Use real-life analogies to make concepts relatable (e.g., supervised learning as a teacher-student scenario).
Foster an interactive environment by encouraging questions and discussions throughout the lesson.
