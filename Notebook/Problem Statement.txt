Problem Statement
Create an API for social networking application using Django Rest Framework with
below functionalities.

Constraints
• Use any database of your choice
• You are free to design Request/Response fields/formats

User Login/Signup
• Users should be able to login with their email and password(email should be case
insensitive)
• User should be able to signup with their email only(no otp verification required, valid
email format is sufficient)
• Except signup and login every api should be called for authenticated users only

Develop API for following functionalities:
• API to search other users by email and name(paginate up to 10 records per page).
a) If search keyword matches exact email then return user associated with the
email.
b) If the search keyword contains any part of the name then return a list of all
users.
eg:- Amarendra, Amar, aman, Abhirama are three users and if users search with "am"
then all of these users should be shown in the search result because "am"
substring is part of all of these names.
c) There will be only one search keyword that will search either by name or email.
• API to send/accept/reject friend request
• API to list friends(list of users who have accepted friend request)
• List pending friend requests(received friend request)
• Users can not send more than 3 friend requests within a minute.

Submission
• Add project in GitHub and share link
• Add ReadMe file having installation steps
• Add requirements.txt
• Containerize applications with docker(you don't need to create image, you can just
add related docker-compose and Docker file).
• Before submitting a project re-verify installation steps, so that it is easy for us to
evaluate.
• Share postman collection for each API endpoints as well for fast evaluation.
