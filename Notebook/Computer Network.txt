					Computer Network
					-----------------
A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. Computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other.

Types of Computer - 
	1. PAN(Personal Area N/w)
	2. LAN(Local Area N/w)
	3. MAN(Metropolitan Area N/w)
	4. WAN(Wide Area N/w)
-----------------------------------------

IP Address - 
	 - IP stands for "Internet Protocol,"
	   which is the set of rules governing
	   the format of data sent via the
	   internet or local network.

	-  In essence, IP addresses are the
	   identifier that allows information to
	   be sent between devices on a
	   network: they contain location
	   information and make devices
	   accessible for communication.
-----------------------------------------------------

Types of IP Address - 

	Public IP Address - https://whatismyipaddress.com/

	Private IP Address - Windows Key+R -> cmd -> ipconfig/ifconfig
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Types of IP Versions - 

	There are two versions of IP that
	currently coexist in the global
	Internet:
- IP version 4 (IPv4)
- IP version 6 (IPv6)

	IP addresses are made up of binary
	values and drive the routing of all
	data over the Internet.

IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, and
IPv6 addresses 128 bits long.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Port Numbers - 
A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.

Total Port Number 0-65535
Example: netstat -a

NETWORK PORTS

Well-known Ports

	0 - 1023

Registered Ports

	1024 - 49151

Dynamic Ports

	49152 - 65565

Protocol

-----------------------------------------------

WHAT IS PROTOCOL?
	Network protocols are a set of rules outlining how connected devices 	communicate across a network to exchange information easily and safely.

	Protocols serve as a common language for devices to enable communication 	irrespective of differences in software, hardware, or internal processes.
	Example: https, http, ftp, ssh, telnet etc.

PROTOCOL -> Message -> Protocol 
(Rules)

What is OSI Model?

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. It was the first standard model for network communications, adopted by all major computer and telecommunication companies in the early 1980s.

OSI Model Explained: The OSI 7 Layers

7.Application Layer - Human-computer interaction layer, where
applications can access the network services

6.Presentation Layer - Ensures that data is in a usable format and is
where data encryption occurs

5.Session Layer - Maintains connections and is responsible for
controlling ports and sessions

4.Transport Layer - Transmits data using transmission protocols
including TCP and UDP

3.Network Layer - Decides which physical path the data will take

2.Data Link layer - Defines the format of data on the network

1.Physical Layer - Transmits raw bit stream over the physical
medium

------------------------------------------------------------------

Network Devices - 

1.ROUTER - 
	A router is a device that connect two or more packet-switched networks or 	subnetworks.

It serves two primary functions:
managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet
connection.

Why we use router?
1.More than 1 different network
2.Firewall
3.DHCP(Automated)

2.Switch -
	witches are networking devices operating at layer 2 or a data link layer 	of the OSI model. They connect devices in a network and use packet 	switching to send, receive or forward data packets or data frames over 	the network.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Client Server Model - 

1.The client/server model is an architecture that distributes applications between servers and client computers.

2.Server: System that provides services such as Windows Server2008 R2.

3.Client: Device that requests services such as Windows 7
